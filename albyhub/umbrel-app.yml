  Alby Hub is an open-source, self-custodial Bitcoin Lightning wallet, with the easiest-to-use Lightning Network node for everyone.
  Whether you're an individual, creator, or developer, Alby Hub is your centre for seamless Bitcoin payments.


  Effortlessly connect to a variety of apps like the Alby Browser Extension or Alby Go mobile app, create sub-wallets for family and friends, and take full control of your funds—all within an intuitive interface and developer-ready APIs.


  🛠️ SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS


  Alby Hub can be set up in two ways:
  
  1) As a standalone app without Lightning Node (LND) installed: On install, choose to "Get Started (LDK)" to start using the embedded LDK based Lightning node.

  2) Connected to the Lightning Node app (LND) running on your Umbrel: Make sure to first install and set up Lightning Node on your Umbrel. Then install Alby Hub, which will automatically configure itself to connect to the Lightning Node app running on your Umbrel.

releaseNotes: >-
  In this hotfix, app pagination is added, improving the performance for hubs with many apps. Additionally, we fix an issue where Alby Hub will ignore the shutdown signal and not gracefully shut down. A password change bug is also addressed, where HTTP requests are unauthorized until Alby Hub is fully restarted. Furthermore, we add a button to migrate standard isolated connections to sub-wallets and include Wave.space in the app store.


  Key fixes in this release:
    - Added app pagination for improved performance
    - Fixed graceful shutdown issue
    - Addressed password change authorization bug
    - Added migration button for isolated connections to sub-wallets
    - Included Wave.space in the app store
